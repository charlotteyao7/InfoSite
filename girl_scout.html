        <p>1910s: How it all began</p>
        <p>Girl Scout Cookies were originally home baked by girl members with moms volunteering as technical advisers.
            The sale of cookies to finance troop activities began as early as 1917, five years after Juliette Gordon Low
            started Girl Scouts in the United States. The Mistletoe Troop in Muskogee, Oklahoma, baked cookies and sold
            them in its high school cafeteria as a service project.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>1920s: Sales go nationwide</p>
        <p>In July 1922, The American Girl magazine, published by Girl Scouts of the USA, featured an article by
            Florence E. Neil, a local director in Chicago, Illinois, including a cookie recipe that had been given to
            the council’s 2,000 Girl Scouts. She estimated the approximate cost of ingredients for six to seven dozen
            cookies to be 26 to 36 cents. The cookies, she suggested, could be sold by troops for 25 or 30 cents per
            dozen.</p>
        <p>Throughout the decade, Girl Scouts in different parts of the country continued to bake their own simple sugar
            cookies with their mothers and with help from the community. These cookies were packaged in wax paper bags,
            sealed with a sticker, and sold door-to-door for 25 to 35 cents per dozen.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>1930s: A marketing revolution</p>
        <p>In 1933, Girl Scouts of Greater Philadelphia Council baked cookies and sold them in the city’s gas and
            electric company windows. The price was just 23 cents per box of 44 cookies, or six boxes for $1.24. Girls
            developed their marketing and business skills and raised funds for their local Girl Scout council. A year
            later, Greater Philadelphia took cookie sales to the next level, becoming the first council to sell
            commercially baked cookies.</p>
        <p>In 1935, the Girl Scout Federation of Greater New York raised money through the sale of commercially baked
            cookies. The group bought its own die in the shape of a trefoil and used the words “Girl Scout Cookies” on
            the box. In 1936, the national Girl Scout organization began the process of licensing the first commercial
            bakers to produce cookies that would be sold nationwide by girls in Girl Scout councils. Enthusiasm for Girl
            Scout Cookies spread, and by 1937, more than 125 Girl Scout councils reported holding cookie sales.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>1940s: Wartime innovations</p>
        <p>Girl Scout Cookies were sold by local councils around the country until World War II, when sugar, flour, and
            butter shortages led Girl Scouts to pivot, selling the first Girl Scout calendars in 1944 as an alternative
            to raise money for activities.</p>
        <p>After the war, cookie sales increased, and by 1948, a total of 29 bakers were licensed to bake Girl Scout
            Cookies.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>1950s: New selling techniques</p>
        <p>In 1951, Girl Scout Cookies came in three varieties: Sandwich, Shortbread, and Chocolate Mints (now known as
            Thin Mints®). With the rise of the suburbs in postwar America, girls began selling Girl Scout Cookies at
            tables in shopping malls.</p>
        <p>Five years later, Girl Scouts were selling four basic types of cookies: a vanilla-based filled cookie, a
            chocolate-based filled one, shortbread, and a chocolate mint. Some bakers also offered another optional
            flavor.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>1960s: Booming in the suburbs</p>
        <p>During the 1960s, as Baby Boomers expanded Girl Scout membership, cookie sales increased significantly.
            Fourteen licensed bakers were mixing batter for thousands upon thousands of Girl Scout Cookies annually. And
            those bakers began wrapping Girl Scout Cookie boxes in printed aluminum foil or cellophane to protect the
            cookies and preserve their freshness.</p>
        <p>By 1966, a number of varieties were available. Among the best sellers were Chocolate Mint, Shortbread, and
            Peanut Butter Sandwich cookies.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>1970s: A groovy new look</p>
        <p>In 1978, the number of bakers was streamlined to four to ensure lower prices and uniform quality, packaging,
            and distribution. For the first time in history, all cookie boxes—regardless of the baker—featured the same
            designs and depicted scenes of Girl Scouts in action, including hiking and canoeing. And in 1979, the
            brand-new, Saul Bass–created Girl Scout logo appeared on cookie boxes, which became even more creative and
            promoted the benefits of Girl Scouting.</p>
        <p>Girl Scout Cookies for sale during the 1970s included Thin Mints, Peanut Butter Sandwich/Do-si-dos®, and
            Shortbread/Trefoils® cookies, plus four additional choices.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p> 1980s: Girl Scouts in action</p>
        <p>In 1982, four bakers still produced a maximum of seven varieties of cookies—three mandatory (Thin Mint,
            Peanut Butter Sandwich/Do-si-dos, and Shortbread/Trefoils) and four optional. Cookie boxes depicted scenes
            of Girl Scouts in action.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>1990s: Awarding entrepreneurs</p>
        <p>In the early 1990s, two licensed bakers supplied local Girl Scout councils with cookies for girls to sell,
            and by 1998, this number had grown again to three. Eight cookie varieties were available, including low-fat
            and sugar-free selections.</p>
        <p>GSUSA also introduced official age-appropriate awards for Girl Scout Brownies, Juniors, Cadettes, and
            Seniors, including the Cookie Activity pin, which was awarded for participating in the cookie sale.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>2000s: Cookies on a mission</p>
        <p>Early in the twenty-first century, every Girl Scout Cookie had a mission. New cookie box designs, introduced
            in fall of 2000, were bold and bright, capturing the spirit of Girl Scouting. Two licensed bakers produced a
            maximum of eight varieties, including three that were mandatory (Thin Mints, Peanut Butter
            Sandwich/Do-si-dos, and Shortbread/Trefoils). All cookies were kosher. And much to the excitement of the
            youngest Girl Scouts, Daisies started selling cookies.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>2010s: Cookies go digital</p>
        <p>With the announcement of National Girl Scout Cookie Weekend (the next one is February 18-20, 2022) and the
            introduction of the very first gluten-free Girl Scout Cookie, the decade was off to a big start. But the
            really big news was the launch of the Digital Cookie® platform in 2014. A fun, safe, and interactive space
            for girls to sell cookies, Digital Cookie takes the iconic cookie program digital and introduces Girl Scouts
            to vital twenty-first-century lessons about online marketing, app usage, and ecommerce. But most
            importantly, Digital Cookie retains the one-to-one personal approach to selling that is essential to the
            success of the program and the girls who participate.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Today: New cookie adventures</p>
        <p>Who can forget the amazing moment in 2016 when Girl Scouts took the stage at the Academy Awards to sell
            cookies to Hollywood’s A-list? It was a stellar beginning to the nationwide celebration of the 100th
            anniversary of Girl Scouts selling cookies. That continued with the introduction of Girl Scout S’mores®,
            which quickly became the most popular new cookie to launch in our history. And in 2020, our already iconic
            cookies reached a new level of awesome with new packaging that puts Girl Scout Cookie entrepreneurs front
            and center and also showcases all of the amazing things girls learn and do—through the Girl Scout Cookie
            Program and as Girl Scouts. The Cookie Entrepreneur Family pin collection that makes selling Girl Scout
            Cookies a family affair was also introduced in 2020.</p>
        <p>And in 2021, all Girl Scout Cookies are both kosher and Halal certified. There are vegan and gluten-free
            varieties too.</p>
        <p>What’s next? In 2022, Girl Scouts across the country will begin selling a new Girl Scout Cookie. </p>
        <p>Adventurefuls™, brownie-inspired cookies topped with caramel flavored crème and a hint of sea salt will take
            the joys of buying and eating Girl Scout Cookies to a whole new level. This is the first time that both
            cookie bakers will introduce the same cookie under a single name.</p>
        <p>Now more than ever, when it comes to Girl Scout Cookies, you can taste the adventure in every delicious bite!
